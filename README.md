A more industrial look and feel for the revered printed Voron Trident and 2.4 Z-assembly. Also greatly slims the whole Z-assembly and adds extra usable Z-height by making the bed itself as a part of the Z-kinematics. Keep in mind, that I do not own an official Voron but instead an adaption from Flying Bear Reborn 2 and this whole process is not complete and that the front carriers and carrier plates can be used to replace printed pieces as far as I'm concnerned, will check it once, again, I have gotten the CAD file of Trident. Flying Bear Reborn 2 owners are good to use these parts as in my printer it's been all happy for the last 200+ printing hours with more than 60C enclosure temperatures.

The bigplate as I like to call it, is only piece connecting two points of the Z-gantry other than the bed itself. This is because of needed movements in case metal swells a bit bigger with heat and give way for the stress to go somewhere. I have yet to create the correct size bigplate for the bed because I created all this from a Trident 250 CAD and butchered it pretty badly. Flying Bear Reborn 2 owners are good to go as it's proven for hundres of hours and I have had no issues with it. Voron Trident bigplate DXFs will be created in near future after I have found the CAD files and correct measurements for Trident 250, 300 and 350.

I recommend to cut the front plates out of AT LEAST 4mm aluminium but go for 6mm, however I used 4mm stainless steel for fronts and 6mm for rear and everything is great. Seems that the rear stepper piece is happy with just two M4 bolts holding it in and it does not move nor bend under a bit more than normal printing conditions. Front plates have adjustabilty option to fine tune the stepper location as the bed will go really low compared to 2020 frame and otherwise very bulky assembly. The printable pieces that carry the plates are recommended to print from material that can resist at least 100C, be it ASA-CF or something better as the heat is conducted throughout the framing and noone wants plastic melt at wrong places.

The bigplate or big X-plate has to be cut from 6mm stainless steel. I might fear the aluminum might be a bit too bendy, but if your printer has 6mm bed it should be fine.

To do this mod you might need to be able to quite possibly drill and tap your bed block for additional hardware.

Hardware I used with adapted Flying Bear Reborn 2 with Annex 350x350x12mm bed and 350mm version of FYSETCH 1000W heater:
- 8x M5x35 with nuts, washers are recommended; for attaching rear and front carriers to the plates. DO NOT overtighten the rear carrier as it might deform the part and misalign the rail cart bolt bores
- 4x M3x40 to attach rear plate carrier to the rear linear rail cart
- 10x M4x8 for 4mm stepper plates or 10x M4x10 for 6mm stepper plates
- 6x M3x12 with nuts for securing the spherical bearings from Voron BOM for front carriers, also these sandwich the bearings in place
- 6x M3x25 and 2x M3x20 for to attach printed front plate carriers to linear rail carts
- 2x M5x16 with nuts to tie X-plate and the spherical bearing together
- 6x M3x10 with nuts to attach brass Z-screws to front Z-assemblies or 6x M4x8 if you tap the threads into brass Z-screws and screw the bolts in them directly. Two bolts are enough, tighten them just enough that they are not loose and check after a while
- 2x M4x20 bolts if you dare to drill and tap two holes into the bed to secure the bigplate to it. Drill the holes in the middle of the ovals so it can still move, place an M5 nut for each of M4 bolts between the bigplate and bed to keep some space between the heater and bigplate so it is not siphoning too much heat from it
OR
2x M4x10 bolts if you just want to add two bolts in the plate as spacers to keep the heater away from the bigplate. I have it like this and the weight holds it steady.
- 2x M3x16 bolts close to the front corners of the bed. Again, holes have to be in the middle of the ovals to let the metals move. Most perfect solution would be with M3x20 bolts and with some really strong springs or couple of millimeters worth of springwashers.
- 12x M3x8, M3x10 or M3x12 bolts for steppers depending of what thickness you chose for the stepper plates - 4mm, 6mm or 8mm. You can add M3 slim washers to the top below the bolt heads. Screw them almost tight, back up half a turn, home the printer and then lower the bed as low as you can and adjust the steppers so the Z-screws are properly upright. Hold the Z-screws from the top and tighten one or two bolts per stepper and that is enough so you can raise the bed high enough for you to acces rest of the stepper bolts and tighten them properly
- 1x M3x16 bolt with a nut to the rear. Put the bolt in from the top of the bed, under the magnet line and tighten it. Once the bed is installed, add a spring or springwasher from below with another nut to secure it to the rear plate. Not the most elegant solution, but it's not designed be rigid and also not designed to be slanted more than few degrees. Bed will be held in position by front carriers and rear is just for support from a third point.
